      <h2>About:</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Quality Assurance (QA) professional and Developer with a passion
        for continuous learning. Over the past few years, I made a transition
        from manual QA to Automation, and during this journey, I acquired skills
        in JavaScript (JS) and TypeScript (TS). Now, I am eager to expand my
        knowledge further in UI and Backend Development. As a QA analyst, I have
        developed a keen eye for detail and a systematic approach to testing. My
        experience has taught me the importance of delivering high-quality
        software that meets user expectations. With my newfound automation
        skills, I have been able to streamline and optimize testing processes,
        leading to increased efficiency and effectiveness in software
        development. However, my curiosity doesn't stop at QA. I am driven to
        explore the world of UI and Backend Development, as I believe these
        areas play a crucial role in building exceptional user experiences and
        robust software solutions. I am excited to delve deeper into these
        domains and broaden my skill set to become a well-rounded developer.
        With a strong foundation in QA and newfound programming skills, I am
        confident in my ability to adapt, learn quickly, and contribute to
        meaningful projects. Let's connect and explore how we can collaborate on
        creating remarkable software solutions.
